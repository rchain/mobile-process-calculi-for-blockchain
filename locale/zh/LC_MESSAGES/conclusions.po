"We have provided a brief review of the technology leading up to an "
"effective rendering of the mobile process calculi as a programming model "
"and execution engine for decentralized networks of programmable VMs. We "
"have described a step by step procedure for realizing this on a "
"blockchain in which the state of the VMs are stored.We have provided the "
"background and design rationale for this approach as a correct-by-"
"construction architecture of a blockchain based public, economic, "
"compute infrastructure."
