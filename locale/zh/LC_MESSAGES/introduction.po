"Beginning back in the early '90s with MCC’s ESS and other nascent "
"efforts a new possibility for the development of distributed and "
"decentralized applications was emerging. This was a virtual machine "
"environment, running as a node in a connected network of such VM-based "
"environments. This idea offered a rich fabric for the development of "
"decentralized, but coordinated applications that was well suited to the "
"Internet model of networked applications. The model of application "
"development that would sit well on top of such a rich environment was a "
"subject of intensive investigation."

"Here we provide a brief, and somewhat idiosyncratic survey of several "
"lines of investigation that converge to a single model for programming "
"and deploying decentralized applications. Notably, the model adapts "
"quite well to the blockchain setting, providing a natural notion of "
"smart contract. As such, this summary can be taken as the design "
"rationale for the RChain architecture, and the rholang model of "
"blockchain-based smart contracts."

"在这里，我们针对于去中心化应用的开发、部署做了一个简单且特殊的调研，并且"
"基于这些调研结果抽象出了一个单一模型。值得注意的是，这个单一模型很好地适"
"应了区块链的一些特点，并且包含了有关智能合约的概念。因此，这个总结可以作"
"为RChain架构的设计原理以及区块链智能合约的rholang模型。"
