"Beginning back in the early '90s with MCC’s ESS and other nascent efforts"
" a new possibility for the development of distributed and decentralized "
"applications was emerging. This was a virtual machine environment, "
"running as a node in a connected network of such VM-based environments. "
"This idea offered a rich fabric for the development of decentralized, but"
" coordinated applications that was well suited to the Internet model of "
"networked applications. The model of application development that would "
"sit well on top of such a rich environment was a subject of intensive "
"investigation."

"Here we provide a brief, and somewhat idiosyncratic survey of several "
"lines of investigation that converge to a single model for programming "
"and deploying decentralized applications. Notably, the model adapts quite"
" well to the blockchain setting, providing a natural notion of smart "
"contract. As such, this summary can be taken as the design rationale for "
"the RChain architecture, and the rholang model of blockchain-based smart "
"contracts."
